#### [**Millet Value Chain in Storage:**](https://milletadvisor.com/millet-value-chain-analysis/)

Millet storage is an essential part of the millet value chain as it plays a critical role in maintaining the quality of millets and preventing post-harvest losses. Here are some important points to consider for millet storage:

1. **Proper Storage Conditions**: The millet should be stored in a clean, dry, and well-ventilated area to prevent moisture accumulation, mold growth, and insect infestation. The storage area should be protected from direct sunlight and rain. The maximum moisture level should be 10-12% to avoid damage.
2. **Proper Cleaning**: Before storage, millets should be cleaned and dried to remove any debris, dust, or moisture. Any damaged or infected grains should be removed to prevent the spread of diseases or pests. The cleaning of the millet can be done with cleaner-cum-grader machines. As per the size of the millet grains, the sieves of the machines need to be changed to get quality grains.
3. **Use of Storage Containers**: Millets can be stored in a variety of containers such as bags, drums, or bins. The containers should be made of materials that are resistant to moisture and pests.
4. **Appropriate Storage Duration**: The storage duration of millet depends on the storage conditions and the initial quality of the grain. Generally, millet can be stored for up to one year if stored under appropriate conditions and it is only applicable to unprocessed grains. If the husks of the millet grains are removed, it has a lower shelf life (3-6 months).

Proper storage of millets can help maintain their quality and reduce post-harvest losses. This can help farmers get better prices for their produce and increase their income.

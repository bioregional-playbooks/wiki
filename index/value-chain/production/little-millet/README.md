# Little Millet

The crop can grow well in drought conditions and considered as a good famine food as it can produce some grain even under severe drought conditions when all the other crops fail to produce. It is a typical dryland crop suitable for the areas with low rainfall and poor soils. (Reference: Seed Production Techniques for Cereals and Millets by CIKS and RRAN. December 2013.)

**Season**&#x20;

• Sowing with onset of monsoon is beneficial.&#x20;

• Middle of June to end of July in different states • Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh: Last week of June to first week of July.

**Spacing** **& Sowing**\
Optimum spacing: Spacing of 22.5 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants.&#x20;

• Line sowing is beneficial as it facilitates Intercultivation and weed management. Seed rate&#x20;

• 10 kg ha-1 • 15 kg ha for line sowing -1 for broad casting. Manuring and fertilization&#x20;

• 5-7.5 t ha-1 • Tamil nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh: 40 kg N and 20 kg P

of farm yard manure

2O5 ha-1

• Other states: 20 kg each of NPK ha-1&#x20;

• High rainfall areas of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, nitrogen should be applied in 2 splits: half of the nitrogen at sowing and remaining half at 35-40 days after sowing. Bio-fertilizers: Treating seeds with Azospirullum brasilense (nitrogen fixing bacterium) and Aspergillus awamouri (phosphate solubalizing fungus) @ 25 g kg-1 is beneficial. The procedure for incorporating seeds with bio fertilizer as given for finger millet is followed. Cropping system Inter cropping

• Madhya Pradesh: Kodo millet + Pigeon pea (2:1 ratio) Kodo millet + Green gram/black gram (2:1 ratio). Kodo millet + Soybean (2:1 ratio). Crop rotation/Cropping sequence&#x20;

• Kodo millet – soybean or Kodo millet or Kodo millet – niger - kodo millet crop was found to be sustainable system in Madhya Pradesh state. Weed control&#x20;

• Hand weeding twice around 20 and 35 days after sowing and 2-3 inter cultivations are necessary.&#x20;

• In assured rain fall areas of Madhya Pradesh pre-emergence application of Isoproturon @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha is also effective in control of weeds. Diseases Head smut caused by Sorosporium paspali-thunbergi is the only major disease. Control: The pathogen being seed borne can be checked by seed treatment with Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb @ 2g/kg. \
The variety GPUK 3 is tolerant to head smut Pests Shootfly: \
\
This is the only serious pest and appears 10 days after sowing resulting in dead hearts. It can cause significant yield losses in years of serious incidence. Control

1. Delayed sowing increases shootfly incidence. Sowing with the onset of monsoon is beneficial.
2. Sow the crop before 2nd
3. Adopt higher seed rate (1 1⁄2 times the recommended seed rate)

fortnight of July 4. Need based application of insecticides.

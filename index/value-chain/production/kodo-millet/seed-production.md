# Seed Production

Seed production of Kodo Millet can be done in June – July and February – March. The pollination should not coincide with rains for quality and effective seed setting.

Method of seed production&#x20;

Kodo millet is a self-pollinated crop. The crop should be raised in isolation. The isolation distance maintained between the varieties is 3 metres for both foundation and certified seed production to maintain the varietal purity. Seed production stages: Breeder seed --> Foundation seed --> Certified seed&#x20;

Land selection&#x20;

The selected land should be free from volunteer plants. The land should not be cultivated with the same crop in the previous season. Land should be fertile with good drainage facility.

Seed selection and sowing&#x20;

Seeds used for seed production should be of good quality certified seeds from an authentic source. Seeds should be healthy with required germination percentage. In North India, sowing should be done in mid June to mid July and in South India during September – December. Recommended seed rate is 4 kg/acre (10 kg/ha). Selected seeds should be treated with Azospirillum @ 60 gms/kg of seeds. Treated seeds should be sown with a spacing of 30 x 10 cm. Seeds should be sown at the depth of 3 – 4 cm.

Main field preparation&#x20;

The main field should be ploughed before the onset of monsoon to enable the soil to hold the moisture. At the onset of monsoon field should be ploughed for 2 – 3 times to make it a fine tilth and formed into ridges and furrows. During final plough apply compost or farmyard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre (12.5 tonnes/ha) and incorporate into the soil. Seeds can be sown in the ridges with a spacing of 30 × 10 cm.&#x20;

Nutrient management&#x20;

Before final ploughing compost or farmyard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre (12.5 tonnes/ha) should be applied and ploughed into the soil. Instead of this cattle penning can also be practiced. 50 kg neem cake and 500 kg vermicompost per acre (125 kg neem cake and 1250 kg vermicompost per hectare) should be applied as basal manure. For rainfed crop, apply 50 kg/acre (125 kg/ hectare) of pungam cake and 250 kg per acre (600 kg / hectare) of vermicompost as basal manure just before sowing. After first weeding at 20 – 25 days after sowing top dressing should be done using enriched vermicompost (2 kg Azospirillum, 2 kg Phosphobacterium and 2 litres Panchagavya mixed with 250 kg vermicompost and kept covered for a week and then used) @ 250 kg/acre (600 kg/ha). During flower initiation stage 10% tender coconut solution (1 litre tender coconut water + 9 litres of water) should be sprayed. All the above mentioned inputs should be applied to the rainfed crop only when the soil is wet.

Weed management&#x20;

The seed production field should be maintained weed free from the initial stage. It is essential to control the weeds in the initial stages of plant growth especially upto 35 – 40 days after sowing. Generally two weedings at an interval of 15 days is sufficient. Weeding can be done with hand hoe or wheel hoe in line sown crop.&#x20;

Irrigation&#x20;

Kharif season crop does not require any irrigation, it is mostly grown as a rainfed crop. In the absence of rains one or two irrigation can be done. During heavy rains the excess water from the field should be drained out.&#x20;

Pest and disease management&#x20;

Kodo millet is affected by shoot fly pest and head smut disease at different growth stages.

Roguing

&#x20;Roguing should be done often to remove the offtypes, volunteer plants and diseased plants from the seed production field to avoid the genetic contamination. Roguing should be done upto the flowering stage. Maximum percentage of offtype permitted at the final inspection is 0.05% for foundation and 0.10% for certified seed production.&#x20;

Field inspection&#x20;

A minimum of two inspections should be done between flowering and maturity stages by the Seed Certification Officer. The first inspection is done at the time of flowering to check the isolation and off-types and the second done during the maturity stage prior to harvest to check the off-types and to estimate the yield.&#x20;

Harvesting and processing&#x20;

Harvest is done once the earheads are physiologically mature. Normally crop is ready for harvest in 100 days. Physiologically mature earheads will turn from brown to green colour. Plants are cut close to the ground level, bundled and stacked for a week before threshing. The earheads are threshed by trampling under the feet of bullocks. The threshed grains are further cleaned by winnowing.&#x20;

Drying and storage&#x20;

The cleaned seeds should be sun dried to attain a safe moisture level of 12%. Care should be taken while drying to avoid mechanical injury to the seeds and contamination. Seeds can be stored upto 13 months under proper storage conditions.&#x20;

Seed standards&#x20;

The percentage of minimum physical purity of certified and foundation seeds should be 97% with a minimum of 75% of germination capacity and 12% of moisture content. The presence of inert matter should not exceed 2.0%.

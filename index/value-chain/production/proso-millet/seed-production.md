# Seed Production

Best season for seed production is June - July and February – March. The pollination should not coincide with rain for quality and effective seed setting.

Method of seed production&#x20;

Proso millet is a self-pollinated crop and should be raised in isolation. The isolation distance maintained between the varieties is 3 metres for both foundation and certified seed production to maintain the varietal purity.&#x20;

Seed production stages: Breeder seed --> Foundation seed --> Certified seed&#x20;

Land selection&#x20;

Proso millet can be cultivated in both rich and poor soils. Well drained loam or sandy loam soils rich in organic matter are ideal for cultivation. The selected land should be free from volunteer plants. The land should not be cultivated with same crop in the previous season.

Seed selection and sowing

Seeds used for seed production should be of good quality certified seeds from an authentic source. Seeds should be healthy with required germination percentage. Recommended seed rate is 4 kg/acre (10 kg/ha). Selected seeds should be treated with Azospirillum @ 60 gms/kg of seeds. Treated seeds should be sown with a spacing of 30 x 10 cm. Seeds should be sown in June – July onset of monsoon rains. Summer crop should be sown in the month of February – March. Seeds are broadcast manually or by seed driller in furrows at a depth of 3 – 4 cm.&#x20;

Main field preparation&#x20;

The main field should be harrowed for 2 – 3 times to make it a fine tilth and levelled. The levelled field is formed into ridges and furrows. During final plough apply compost or farmyard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre (12.5 tonnes/ha) and incorporate into the soil. Seeds can be sown in the ridges at a depth 3 - 4 cm with a spacing of 30× 10 cm.

Nutrient management

Before final ploughing compost or farmyard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre (12.5 tonnes/ha) should be applied and ploughed into the soil. Instead of this cattle penning can also be practiced. 50 kg neem cake and 500 kg vermicompost per acre (125 kg neem cake and 1250 kg vermicompost per hectare) should be applied as basal manure. For rainfed crop, apply 50 kg/acre (125 kg/ hectare) of pungam cake and 250 kg/acre (600 kg/hectare) of vermicompost as basal manure just before sowing. After first weeding at 20 – 25 days after sowing top dressing should be done using enriched vermicompost (2 kg Azospirillum, 2 kg Phosphobacterium and 2 litres Panchagavya mixed with 250 kg vermicompost and kept covered for a week and then used) @ 250 kg/acre (600 kg/ha). During flower initiation stage 10% tender coconut solution (1 litre tender coconut water + 9 litres of water) should be sprayed. All the above mentioned inputs should be applied to the rainfed crop only when the soil is wet.

Weed management&#x20;

The seed production field should be maintained weed free at least upto 35 days after sowing for retaining the soil moisture and nutrients. Subsequent weeding should be done at an interval of 15 – 20 days. Weeding can be done with a handhoe or wheel hoe.

Irrigation&#x20;

Kharif season crop does not require any irrigation. However, if the dry spell prevails for longer period 1 - 2 irrigations should be given at the tillering stage to boost the yield. First irrigation should be given 25 - 30 days after sowing followed by the second one at 40 – 45 days after sowing. Summer crop requires 2 - 4 irrigations depending upon soil type and climatic conditions. During heavy rains the excess water from the field should be drained out.

Pest and disease management

Proso millet is commonly affected by shoot fly and there is no other remarkable disease incidence.

Roguing&#x20;

Roguing should be done often to remove the offtypes, volunteer plants and diseased plants from the seed production field to avoid the genetic contamination. Roguing should be done upto the flowering stage. Maximum percentage of offtypes permitted at the final inspection is 0.05% for foundation and 0.10% for certified seed production.

Field inspection&#x20;

A minimum of two inspections should be done between flowering and maturity stages by the Seed Certification Officer. The first inspection is done at the time of flowering to check the isolation and off-types and the second inspection is done during the maturity stage prior to harvest to check the off-types and to estimate the yield.

Harvesting and processing

Harvest is done once the earheads are physiologically mature. Normally crop is ready for harvest in 65 - 75 days after sowing. The crop should be harvested when two thirds of the seeds are ripe. The harvested earheads are threshed by hand or trampling under the feet of bullocks. The threshed grains are further cleaned by winnowing.

Drying and storage&#x20;

The cleaned seeds should be sun dried to attain a safe moisture level of 12%. Seeds can be stored upto 13 months under proper storage conditions.

Seed standards&#x20;

The percentage of minimum physical purity of certified and foundation seeds should be 97% with a minimum of 75% of germination capacity and 12% of moisture content. The presence of inert matter should not exceed 2.0%.

The millets which are covered in this manual are Proso, Finger, Foxtail, Sorghum, Pearl, Kodo, Little, Barnyard Millets. It also covers pest management in case of millets; This manual is useful for trainers, CSOs, SHGs.

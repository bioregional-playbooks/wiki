Land preparation Timely ploughing is advantageous for moisture conservation. In the month of April or May, one deep ploughing with mould-board plough is recommended. Followed by, ploughing with wooden plough twice is necessary. Before sowing, secondary tillage with cultivator using multiple tooth hoe to prepare smooth seed bed is necessary. Minor land smoothening before sowing helps in better in situ moisture conservation. Seeds are very small and take 5-7 days to germinate. Hence, good seeds and land preparation helps in better germination, minimize weed problem and effective soil moisture conservation. In Uttaranchal where frequent ploughing operations are difficult to carry out, effective digging and turning of soil, removing perennial weeds, land smoothening, providing inward slope with a shallow drain helps in taking out excess rain water. Soil and moisture conservation practices To increase soil quality, summer ploughing or ploughing after the harvest of previous crop. Ploughing can be done across the slope. Erection of small section bunds at an interval of 10-12 m depending on the slope and levelling of the depressions. Opening a dead furrow at 3.3 to 4.0 m interval is required. Seed rate Seed rate of 8-10 kg/ha (line sowing) is advised and 4-5 kg/ha (transplanting). A seed rate of 10 kg/ha is found to be optimum for drill sowing and 5 kg/ha for raising seedlings for transplanted condition. Seed treatment Seed should be treated with Thiram @ 2.5 g/kg of seed to prevent diseases. Sowing time Suitable time for sowing is for Kharif- June to July, for Rabi- September to October. Crop is generally grown during kharif season. In certain regions the crop is grown during rabi season under irrigated condition. Method of sowing Line sowing is beneficial, helps in inter-cultivation and control of weeds effectively. Maintenance of optimum plant population of 4-5 lakh/ha is attained by line sowing using seed drill giving a spacing

33

of 22.5-30.0 cm between rows and 7.5-10.0 cm between plants. Transplanting is done underirrigated condition. Nursery management An area of 150 m2

is required to raise seedlings for 1.0 ha. Apply 2-3 baskets of well decomposed farm yard mannure (FYM) along with 1.0 kg super phosphate, half kg muriate of potash and half kg ammonium phosphate and 750 g zinc sulphate per bed. Sow the seeds by opening rows at every 3 inch uniformly. Cover the seed with well decomposed FYM and soil/ sand/ water every bed. Top dress with urea 500 g per bed when the seedlings are 12-14 days old. Seedlings of 21-25 days old are ideal for transplanting in rows of 22.5-25 cm with 2 seedlings/hill with 10 cm between hills. Spacing and fertilizers In direct sowing spacing between rows should be 22.5 to 30 cm, plant to plant 7.5 cm and depth 3-4 cm. Application of additional quantities of organic matter in soil for finger millet is considered beneficial, since it helps to improve physical condition of soil which helps soil to retain moisture for a longer period of time. Manures are applied 5-10 t/ha FYM about a month before sowing. The crop responds well to fertilizer application. The general recommendation for finger millet is 60 kg N, 30 kg P2 O5

and 30 kg K2

O per ha under irrigation and 40 kg N, 20 kg P2 O5 and 20 kg K2

O per ha under rainfed

conditions.

depending upon moisture availability. In areas of good rainfall and moisture availability: 50% of recommended N is to be applied at sowing and the remaining 50% in two equal splits at 25-30 and 40-45 days after sowing. In areas of uncertain rainfall: 50% at sowing and the remaining 50% around 35 days after sowing is recommended. Bio-fertilizers Treating seeds with Azospirillum brasilense (N fixing bacterium) and Aspergillus awamori (P Solubilizing fungus) @ 25 g/kg seed is beneficial. In case seeds are to be treated with seed dressing chemicals, treat the seeds first with seed dressing chemicals and then with bio-fertilizers at the time of sowing.

34 Procedure for inoculating seeds with bio-fertilizers Bio-fertilizer culture-specific to the crop is to be used @ 25g/kg of seed. Sticker solution is necessary for effective seed inoculation. This can be prepared by dissolving 25 g jaggery or sugar in 250 ml water and boiling for 5 minutes. The solution thus, prepared is cooled. Smear the seeds well using the required quantity of sticker solution. Then add culture to the seeds and mix thoroughly so as to get a fine coating of culture on the seed. The culture-coated seed is to be dried well in shade to avoid clumping of seeds. Use of the inoculated seeds for sowing can be done. Irrigation management: Finger millet is generally grown in kharif under rain-fed conditions. If there is any longer dry spell, then irrigation would be required depending on soil type, weather condition and duration of variety. For light soils, irrigate the crop once in 6-8 days, and for heavy soils once in 12-15 days. Under limited irrigation, the crop may be irrigated at critical growth stages like tilling and flowering. Important weeds Grassy weeds: Echinochloa colonum, Enchinochloa crusgulli (sawan), Dactyloctenium aegypticum (makra), Elusine indica, Setaria glauca (bajra), Cynodon dactylon (doob), Phragmites karka (narkul), Cyperus rotundus (motha) and Sorghum halepanse (banchari) are common. Broad-leaved weeds: Celosia argentia (chilimil), Commelina benghalensis (kankoua), Phylanthus niruri (hulhul), Solanum nigrum (makoi) and Amaranthus viridis (chaulai). Weed Control It is essential to control weeds in the initial stage of plant growth and development. The inter-cultivation and weeding should be done with hand hoe at 25 DAS. In line sown crop 2-3 times inter-cultivation and one time hand weeding is suggested. For Broadcast crop two effective hand weeding will minimize weeds. In assured rainfall and irrigated areas, pre-emergence spray with Isoproturon @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha. (rainfed areas), Oxyflurofen @ 0.1 lit a.i./ha (irrigated areas) can be done. For post-emergence spray 2, 4-D sodium salt @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha around 20-25 days after sowing is recommended. Inter cropping

Crop rotation Northern states: Rotation with legumes like green gram/black gram/rice bean/soybean is recommended Southern states: Generally, in southern states horse gram, pigeon pea, field bean or groundnut are used for crop rotation. This practice will minimize inorganic fertilizer application and also give higher yields. Finger millet-finger millet rotation must be discouraged as it affects sustainability of soil as well as crop yield. Crop sequence Northern Bihar: Potato-paddy-finger millet cropping sequence is highly remunerative than other cropping sequences for garden land. Southern Karnataka or Deccan plateau: Finger millet-potato-maize or finger millet-onion-finger millet are highly remunerative cropping sequences. Assured rainfall areas: raising crop of cowpea or green gram or sesamum followed by sowing/ transplanting of early duration finger millet can be practiced. Insect pests and their management Finger millet attracts several pests of which army worm, cutworm, stem borer, leaf aphid, grasshoppers, grey weevil, shoot fly and ear caterpillars are major ones. Army worms and cut worms They appear during the early stages and continue up to harvest. The caterpillars cut seedlings at the base during early stage, which appears as if grazed by domestic animal. They are active during night and hide under stones and clods during the day. In later stages of plant growth, these insects act as defoliators. They are cyclic in nature. Control Apply poison baits comprising 10 kg rice bran + 1 kg Jaggery + 1 l quinolphos (25% EC). Prepare small balls and broadcast in the fields preferably in the evening time. Leaf aphid It occurs throughout the crop growing period. The nymphs and adults suck the sap from tender leaves and stem. They can cause serious damage in the seedling stage up to 30 days. Control Spraying of Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.5 ml/liter of water gives effective control. Stem borer The larva bores into the stem, resulting in dead heart. Control Spraying the crop with Metasystox 25 EC @ 2 ml/liter of water helps in control of borer.

Earhead caterpillars Earhead caterpillars appear at dough stage on ears and persist till harvest. The caterpillars bite the maturing seeds and make a fine web out of their casting and half eaten grains. This further attracts saprophytic fungi. Control Dust Malathion 5% @ 24 kg/ha or Quinolphos 1.5% @ 24 kg/ha. Diseases and their management Blast (Pyricularia grisea) Typical blast lesions are diamond shaped with grey center and dark margin appear on the leaf. Any part of plant including leaves, peduncle and grains can be infected. Grains of infected earheads are shrivelled and become light in weight. Control It can be controlled by growing resistant varieties. Treat the seeds with fungicides like Carbendazim @ 2g/kg seed a day before sowing. If necessary, spray the nursery with Carbendazim (0.1%) or Tricyclazole (0.1%). Spray any of the above advised fungicides at flowering stage and repeat 10 days later to control neck and finger blast. Brown spot Small and medium size brown to dark spot appear on the leaf, leaf sheath, and other plant parts. Damage could be severe if the crop is subjected to drought or nutrition deficiency. Control The disease can be effectively managed by proper nutrition and water management. Need-based spraying of Mancozeb (0.2%) can be applied. Harvesting The crop matures in about 95 to 110 days in case of early varieties and 115 to 125 days in case of medium to late duration varieties depending on the region and the variety. The ear heads are harvested with ordinary sickles and straw is cut close to ground. At some places under rainfed condition, the whole plant with ear head is cut, heaped and then threshed. Yield It is possible to harvest 25-30 q/ha of grain under well managed conditions and 60-70 q/ha of fodder. The straw of finger millet makes nutritious fodder and it is preferred over paddy straw. It can be preserved by putting up in well-built stacks.

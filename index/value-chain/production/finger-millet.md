**Tillage**&#x20;

Fall ploughing is advantageous for moisture conservation. In the month of April or May, one deep ploughing with mould board plough Followed by ploughing with wooden plough twice is necessary. Before sowing secondary tillage with cultivator and multiple tooth hoe to prepare smooth seed bed is necessary.&#x20;

Minor land smoothening before sowing helps in better in-situ moisture conservation. Seeds are very small and take 5-7 days to germinate. Hence good seeds, land preparation helps in better germination, minimize weeds problem and effective soil moisture conservation.&#x20;

In Uttaranchal where frequent ploughing operations are difficult to carry out effective digging and turning of soil, removing perennial weeds, land smoothening, providing inward slope with a shallow drain helps in taking out excess rain water.&#x20;

**Seed rate:**&#x20;

Seed rate: A seed rate of 10 kg ha-1 is found to be optimum for drill sowing and 5 kg ha-1  for raising seedlings for transplanted condition.

**Sowing/Planting**

Line sowing is beneficial helps in inter cultivation and control of weeds effectively. Maintenance of optimum plant population of 4-5 lakh plants ha-1 this is attained by line sowing using seed drill giving a spacing of 22.5-30 cm between rows and 7.5-10 cm between plants

Transplanting in irrigated condition&#x20;

Entire P2O5 and K2O are to be applied at sowing, whereas nitrogen is to be applied in two or three split doses depending upon moisture availability. &#x20;

In areas of good rainfall and moisture availability: 50% of recommended nitrogen is to be applied at sowing and the remaining 50% in two equal splits at 25-30 and 40-45 days after sowing.&#x20;

In areas of uncertain rainfall: 50% at sowing and the remaining 50% around 35 days after sowing is recommended.&#x20;

Adequate application of FYM, 7.5 to 10 tonnes per hectare help in better development of root growth.&#x20;

**Bio-fertilizers:**&#x20;

Treating seeds with Azospirillumbrasilense(N fixing bacterium) and Aspergillusawamori(P Solubilizing fungus) @ 25 g/kg seed is beneficial. In case seeds are to be treated with seed dressing chemicals, treat the seeds first with seed dressing chemicals and then with bio-fertilizers at the time of sowing. Procedure for inoculating seeds with bio-fertilizers

1. Bio-fertilizer culture specific to the crop is to be used @ 25g per kg of seed.
2. Sticker solution is necessary for effective seed inoculation. This can be prepared by dissolving 25 g jaggery or sugar in 250 ml water and boiling for 5 minutes. The solution thus prepared is cooled.
3. Smear the seeds well using the required quantity of sticker solution. Then add culture to the seeds and mix thoroughly so as to get a fine coating of culture on the seed.
4. The culture-coated seed is to be dried well in shade to avoid clumping of seeds.
5. Use the inoculated seeds for sowing.&#x20;

**Soil and moisture conservation practices**&#x20;

a) Summer ploughing or ploughing after the harvest of previous crop&#x20;

b) Ploughing across the slope&#x20;

c) Errection of small section bunds at an interval of 10-12m depending up on the slope and levelling the depressions&#x20;

d) Opening a dead furrow at 3.3 to 4.0 m interval.&#x20;

**Nursery management**

An area of 150 m2 is required to raise seedlings to suffice 1 ha.35-38 beds of 4 feet wide and 25 feet long and 4 inches height fine seed bed is required.

&#x20;Apply 2-3 baskets of well decomposed FYM along with 1 kg super phosphate, half kg muriate of potash and half kg ammonium phosphate and 750 g zinc sulphate per bed. Sow the seeds by opening rows at every 3 inch uniformly. Cover the seed with well decomposed FYM and soil/sand/water every bed. Top dress with urea 500 g per bed when the seedlings are 12-14 days old.  Seedlings of 21-25 days old are ideal for transplanting in rows of 22.5-25 cm with 2 seedlings /hill with 10 cm between hills. Treating seeds with Azospirullumbrasilense (nitrogen fixing bacterium) and Aspergillusawamouri (phosphate solubalizing fungus) @ 25 g kg-1 is beneficial.

Cropping Systems: Inter cropping, crop rotation and cropping sequence

**Inter cropping State  and System**&#x20;

Karnataka, Tamil nadu and Andra pradesh : Finger millet + Pigeon pea 8-10:2 Finger millet +Filed bean 8:1 Finger millet + Soybean 4:1&#x20;

Bihar : Finger millet + Pigeon pea 6:2&#x20;

Uttaranchal Finger millet and Soybean mixed together in 90:10 per cent proportion by weight basis&#x20;

North hilly areas Finger millet + Soybean in Kharif and oats in rabi is an ideal remunerative sequence&#x20;

Maharashtra ( Kolhapur) Finger millet + black gram / moong bean 6-8 : 1 (Sub montane regions)&#x20;

**Crop Rotation**&#x20;

Northern states: Rotation with legumes like green gram/black gram/rice bean/soybean&#x20;

Southern states: a. Horse gram, pigeon pea, field bean or ground nut b. This practice will minimize inorganic fertilizer application and also sustain higher yields. c. Finger millet-finger millet rotation must be discouraged as it affects sustainability of soil as well as crop yield.&#x20;

**Cropping sequence**&#x20;

Northern Bihar: Potato-paddy-finger millet cropping sequence is highly remunerative than other cropping sequences for garden land.&#x20;

Southern Karnataka or Deccan plateau: Finger millet-potato-maize or finger millet-onion-finger millet are highly remunerative cropping sequences.&#x20;

Assured rainfall areas: raising crop of cowpea or green gram or Sesamum followed by sowing / transplanting of early duration finger millet can be practiced.&#x20;

Weed control: Weeds problem in ragi crop can be effectively managed by cultural and mechanical measures&#x20;

Line sowing: 2-3 inter cultivations and one hand weeding&#x20;

Broadcast crop: 2 effective hand weeding will minimize weeds&#x20;

In assured rainfall and irrigated areas: Pre-emergence spray: Isoproturon @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha. (Rainfed areas), Oxyflurofen @ 0.1 lta.i /ha (Irrigated areas)&#x20;

Post-emergent spray: 2, 4-D sodium salt @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha Spraying around 20-25 days after sowing effectively control weeds.&#x20;

**Irrigation**&#x20;

Depending on soil type, weather condition and duration of variety, 8-14 irrigations are necessary.&#x20;

Light soils: Irrigate the crop once in 6-8 days&#x20;

Heavy soils: once in 12-15 days.&#x20;

**Diseases**&#x20;

Finger millet is affected by a variety of diseases of which blast caused by Pyriculariagriseais the major problem. The disease is quite severe in kharif crop at all the growth stages. The losses caused will be more if the disease appears in the nursery and on the ears affecting the neck and fingers.&#x20;

**Management**&#x20;

a. By growing resistant varieties like GPU 28, GPU 26 and GPU 48.&#x20;

b. Treating seeds with fungicides like carbendazim @ 2g/kg a day before sowing&#x20;

c. If necessary spraying the nursery with carbendazim (0.05%) or kitazin (0.1%) or Ediphefos (0.1%) or Saaf (0.2%)&#x20;

d. Spray any of the above fungicides at 50 per cent flowering and repeat 10 days later if Kitazin or Ediphenfos were used to control neck and finger blast.&#x20;

In recent years, brown spot caused by Drechsleranodulosa is gaining importance. Its damage could be severe if the crop is subjected to drought or nutrition deficiency. The disease can be effectively managed by proper nutrition and water management. Need based spraying of Mancozeb or Saaf (0.2%) can be resorted to.&#x20;

Other diseases affecting the crop are mottle streak & streak virus, foot rot (Sclerotiumrolfsii), downy mildew or green ear (Sclerosporamacrospora), grain smut (Melanopsichiumeleusinis). Besides, at higher altitudes Cercopsporaa leaf spot and in the coastal regions sheath blight (Rhizoctonia sp.) also appear, but are of minor importance.&#x20;

**Pests**&#x20;

Finger millet attracts several pests of which army worm, cutworm, stemborer, leaf aphid, grasshoppers, grey weevil, shootfly and ear caterpillars are important.&#x20;

**Army worms and cut worms**&#x20;

They appear during the early stages and continue upto harvest. The caterpillars cut seedlings at the base during early stage, which appears as if grazed by domestic animal. They are active during night and hide under stones and clods during the day. In later stages of plant growth, these insects act as defoliators. They are cyclic in nature.&#x20;

Control&#x20;

When the symptoms are noticed take up dusting of Malathion 5% @ 24 kg/ha or Endosulfan 4% @ 12 kg/ha or Phasolone 5% @ 24 kg / ha or Quinolfos 1.5% @ 24 kg/ha.&#x20;

**Leaf aphid**&#x20;

It occurs throughout the crop growing period. The nymphs and adults suck the sap from tender leaves and stem. They can cause serious damage in the seedling stage upto 30 days.&#x20;

Control&#x20;

Spray Dimethioate (0.05%) or quinolfos (0.05%).&#x20;

**Stemborers**&#x20;

The larva bores into the stem, resulting in dead heart.&#x20;

Control&#x20;

Spray the crop with Dimethioate (0.05%) or Phosphamidon (0.05%) or Monocrotophos (0.04%)&#x20;

**Ear caterpillars**&#x20;

Ear caterpillars appear at dough stage on ears and persist till harvest. The caterpillars bite the maturing seeds and make a fine web out of their casting and half eaten grains. Thisfurther attracts saprophytic fungi.&#x20;

Control&#x20;

Dust Malathion 5% @ 24 kg/ha or Quinolfos 1.5% @ 24 kg/ha or Endosulfan 4% @ 24 kg/ha or Phosalone 4% @ 24 kg/ha.

Land preparation Timely ploughing is advantageous for moisture conservation. In the month of April or May, one deep ploughing with mould-board plough is recommended. Followed by, ploughing with wooden plough twice is necessary. Before sowing, secondary tillage with cultivator using multiple tooth hoe to prepare smooth seed bed is necessary. Minor land smoothening before sowing helps in better in situ moisture conservation. Seeds are very small and take 5-7 days to germinate.

In Uttaranchal where frequent ploughing operations are difficult to carry out, effective digging and turning of soil, removing perennial weeds, land smoothening, providing inward slope with a shallow drain helps in taking out excess rain water. Soil and moisture conservation practices To increase soil quality, summer ploughing or ploughing after the harvest of previous crop. Ploughing can be done across the slope. Erection of small section bunds at an interval of 10-12 m depending on the slope and levelling of the depressions. Opening a dead furrow at 3.3 to 4.0 m interval is required. Seed rate Seed rate of 8-10 kg/ha (line sowing) is advised and 4-5 kg/ha (transplanting). A seed rate of 10 kg/ha is found to be optimum for drill sowing and 5 kg/ha for raising seedlings for transplanted condition. Seed treatment Seed should be treated with Thiram @ 2.5 g/kg of seed to prevent diseases. Sowing time Suitable time for sowing is for Kharif- June to July, for Rabi- September to October. Crop is generally grown during kharif season. In certain regions the crop is grown during rabi season under irrigated condition. Method of sowing Line sowing is beneficial, helps in inter-cultivation and control of weeds effectively. Maintenance of optimum plant population of 4-5 lakh/ha is attained by line sowing using seed drill giving a spacing

33

of 22.5-30.0 cm between rows and 7.5-10.0 cm between plants. Transplanting is done underirrigated condition. Nursery management An area of 150 m2

is required to raise seedlings for 1.0 ha. Apply 2-3 baskets of well decomposed farm yard mannure (FYM) along with 1.0 kg super phosphate, half kg muriate of potash and half kg ammonium phosphate and 750 g zinc sulphate per bed. Sow the seeds by opening rows at every 3 inch uniformly. Cover the seed with well decomposed FYM and soil/ sand/ water every bed. Top dress with urea 500 g per bed when the seedlings are 12-14 days old. Seedlings of 21-25 days old are ideal for transplanting in rows of 22.5-25 cm with 2 seedlings/hill with 10 cm between hills. Spacing and fertilizers In direct sowing spacing between rows should be 22.5 to 30 cm, plant to plant 7.5 cm and depth 3-4 cm. Application of additional quantities of organic matter in soil for finger millet is considered beneficial, since it helps to improve physical condition of soil which helps soil to retain moisture for a longer period of time. Manures are applied 5-10 t/ha FYM about a month before sowing. The crop responds well to fertilizer application. The general recommendation for finger millet is 60 kg N, 30 kg P2 O5

and 30 kg K2

O per ha under irrigation and 40 kg N, 20 kg P2 O5 and 20 kg K2

O per ha under rainfed

conditions.

depending upon moisture availability. In areas of good rainfall and moisture availability: 50% of recommended N is to be applied at sowing and the remaining 50% in two equal splits at 25-30 and 40-45 days after sowing. In areas of uncertain rainfall: 50% at sowing and the remaining 50% around 35 days after sowing is recommended. Bio-fertilizers Treating seeds with Azospirillum brasilense (N fixing bacterium) and Aspergillus awamori (P Solubilizing fungus) @ 25 g/kg seed is beneficial. In case seeds are to be treated with seed dressing chemicals, treat the seeds first with seed dressing chemicals and then with bio-fertilizers at the time of sowing.

34 Procedure for inoculating seeds with bio-fertilizers Bio-fertilizer culture-specific to the crop is to be used @ 25g/kg of seed. Sticker solution is necessary for effective seed inoculation. This can be prepared by dissolving 25 g jaggery or sugar in 250 ml water and boiling for 5 minutes. The solution thus, prepared is cooled. Smear the seeds well using the required quantity of sticker solution. Then add culture to the seeds and mix thoroughly so as to get a fine coating of culture on the seed. The culture-coated seed is to be dried well in shade to avoid clumping of seeds. Use of the inoculated seeds for sowing can be done. Irrigation management: Finger millet is generally grown in kharif under rain-fed conditions. If there is any longer dry spell, then irrigation would be required depending on soil type, weather condition and duration of variety. For light soils, irrigate the crop once in 6-8 days, and for heavy soils once in 12-15 days. Under limited irrigation, the crop may be irrigated at critical growth stages like tilling and flowering. Important weeds Grassy weeds: Echinochloa colonum, Enchinochloa crusgulli (sawan), Dactyloctenium aegypticum (makra), Elusine indica, Setaria glauca (bajra), Cynodon dactylon (doob), Phragmites karka (narkul), Cyperus rotundus (motha) and Sorghum halepanse (banchari) are common. Broad-leaved weeds: Celosia argentia (chilimil), Commelina benghalensis (kankoua), Phylanthus niruri (hulhul), Solanum nigrum (makoi) and Amaranthus viridis (chaulai). Weed Control It is essential to control weeds in the initial stage of plant growth and development. The inter-cultivation and weeding should be done with hand hoe at 25 DAS. In line sown crop 2-3 times inter-cultivation and one time hand weeding is suggested. For Broadcast crop two effective hand weeding will minimize weeds. In assured rainfall and irrigated areas, pre-emergence spray with Isoproturon @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha. (rainfed areas), Oxyflurofen @ 0.1 lit a.i./ha (irrigated areas) can be done. For post-emergence spray 2, 4-D sodium salt @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha around 20-25 days after sowing is recommended. Inter cropping

Crop rotation Northern states: Rotation with legumes like green gram/black gram/rice bean/soybean is recommended Southern states: Generally, in southern states horse gram, pigeon pea, field bean or groundnut are used for crop rotation. This practice will minimize inorganic fertilizer application and also give higher yields. Finger millet-finger millet rotation must be discouraged as it affects sustainability of soil as well as crop yield. Crop sequence Northern Bihar: Potato-paddy-finger millet cropping sequence is highly remunerative than other cropping sequences for garden land. Southern Karnataka or Deccan plateau: Finger millet-potato-maize or finger millet-onion-finger millet are highly remunerative cropping sequences. Assured rainfall areas: raising crop of cowpea or green gram or sesamum followed by sowing/ transplanting of early duration finger millet can be practiced. Insect pests and their management Finger millet attracts several pests of which army worm, cutworm, stem borer, leaf aphid, grasshoppers, grey weevil, shoot fly and ear caterpillars are major ones. Army worms and cut worms They appear during the early stages and continue up to harvest. The caterpillars cut seedlings at the base during early stage, which appears as if grazed by domestic animal. They are active during night and hide under stones and clods during the day. In later stages of plant growth, these insects act as defoliators. They are cyclic in nature. Control Apply poison baits comprising 10 kg rice bran + 1 kg Jaggery + 1 l quinolphos (25% EC). Prepare small balls and broadcast in the fields preferably in the evening time. Leaf aphid It occurs throughout the crop growing period. The nymphs and adults suck the sap from tender leaves and stem. They can cause serious damage in the seedling stage up to 30 days. Control Spraying of Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.5 ml/liter of water gives effective control. Stem borer The larva bores into the stem, resulting in dead heart. Control Spraying the crop with Metasystox 25 EC @ 2 ml/liter of water helps in control of borer.

36

Earhead caterpillars Earhead caterpillars appear at dough stage on ears and persist till harvest. The caterpillars bite the maturing seeds and make a fine web out of their casting and half eaten grains. This further attracts saprophytic fungi. Control Dust Malathion 5% @ 24 kg/ha or Quinolphos 1.5% @ 24 kg/ha. Diseases and their management Blast (Pyricularia grisea) Typical blast lesions are diamond shaped with grey center and dark margin appear on the leaf. Any part of plant including leaves, peduncle and grains can be infected. Grains of infected earheads are shrivelled and become light in weight. Control It can be controlled by growing resistant varieties. Treat the seeds with fungicides like Carbendazim @ 2g/kg seed a day before sowing. If necessary, spray the nursery with Carbendazim (0.1%) or Tricyclazole (0.1%). Spray any of the above advised fungicides at flowering stage and repeat 10 days later to control neck and finger blast. Brown spot Small and medium size brown to dark spot appear on the leaf, leaf sheath, and other plant parts. Damage could be severe if the crop is subjected to drought or nutrition deficiency. Control The disease can be effectively managed by proper nutrition and water management. Need-based spraying of Mancozeb (0.2%) can be applied. Harvesting The crop matures in about 95 to 110 days in case of early varieties and 115 to 125 days in case of medium to late duration varieties depending on the region and the variety. The ear heads are harvested with ordinary sickles and straw is cut close to ground. At some places under rainfed condition, the whole plant with ear head is cut, heaped and then threshed. Yield It is possible to harvest 25-30 q/ha of grain under well managed conditions and 60-70 q/ha of fodder. The straw of finger millet makes nutritious fodder and it is preferred over paddy straw. It can be preserved by putting up in well-built stacks.

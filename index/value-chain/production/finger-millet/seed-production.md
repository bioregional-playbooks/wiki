# Seed Production

The best season for seed production is December – January. Pollination should not coincide with rains for quality and effective seed setting. The temperature of 37°c is favourable for seed setting.

Method of seed production&#x20;

Finger Millet or Ragi is a self-pollinated crop and should be raised in isolation. The isolation distance maintained between the varieties is 3 metres for both foundation and certified seed production to maintain the varietal purity.&#x20;

Seed production stages: Breeder seed --> Foundation seed --> Certified seed&#x20;

Land selection

Ragi can be grown in poor to fertile soil. The crop can tolerate salinity better than any other crops. The selected land should be free from volunteer plants. The land should not be cultivated with same crop in the previous season. Land should be ploughed 2 - 3 times to get fine tilth and levelled.

Seed selection and sowing&#x20;

Ragi is a season bound crop and the best season to take up sowing is December - January and June - July. Seeds used for seed production should be of good quality certified seeds from an authentic source. Seeds should be healthy with required germination percentage. Recommended seed rate is 2 kg/acre (5 kg/ha). Selected seeds should be treated with Azospirillum @ 125gms/kg of seeds.

Nursery preparation&#x20;

Nursery should be raised in an area of 500m2 to plant one hectare of main field (200m2 per acre). Selected nursery plot should be ploughed for two to three times to have fine tilth of soil. Raised beds should be formed and shallow rills are formed over the beds by passing the fingers vertically. Seed should be broadcasted and covered with a thin layer of farmyard manure @ 500 kg/ha (200 kg/acre).&#x20;

Main field preparation

The main field is prepared with 2 – 3 ploughing to make it a fine tilth and formed into ridges and furrows. During final plough apply compost or farmyard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre (12.5 tonnes/ ha) and incorporate into the soil. 20 - 25 days old seedlings transplanted to the main field. Two seedlings per hill should be planted. Follow a spacing of 15× 15 cm.&#x20;

Nutrient management&#x20;

Before final ploughing compost or farmyard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre (12.5 tonnes/ha) should be applied and ploughed into the soil. Instead of this cattle penning can also be practiced. 50 kg neem cake and 500 kg vermicompost per acre (125 kg neem cake and 1250 kg vermicompost per hectare) should be applied as basal manure. After first weeding at 20 – 25 days after sowing first top dressing should be done using enriched vermicompost (2 kg Azospirillum, 17 2 kg Phosphobacterium and 2 litres Panchagavya mixed with 250 kg vermicompost and kept covered for a week and then used) @ 250 kg/acre (600 kg/ha) followed by the second top dressing at 40 – 45 days after sowing using 25 kg neem cake and 250 kg vermicompost per acre (60 kg neem cake and 600 kg vermicompost per hectare). During flower initiation stage 10% tender coconut solution (1 litre tender coconut water + 9 litres of water) should be sprayed. For rainfed crop, 50 kg pungam cake and 250 kg vermicompost should be applied as basal manure just before sowing. First top dressing should be done at 20 – 25 days after sowing using 250 kg/ acre of enriched vermicompost. At 40 – 45 days after sowing apply 25 kg pungam cake and 250 kg vermicompost per acre (60 kg pungam cake and 600 kg vermicompost per hectare) as second top dressing. Spray 10% tender coconut water at the time of flower initiation. All the above mentioned inputs should be applied to the rainfed crop only when the soil is wet.&#x20;

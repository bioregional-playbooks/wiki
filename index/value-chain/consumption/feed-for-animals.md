## The use of millet grains in chicken diets&#x20;

The inclusion of millet grains in animal feed has gained momentum in recent years. A study by \[87] has shown that whole pearl millet grain can be included in the broiler diet by up to 50% without it having a negative effect on performance. In addition, feeding pearl millet to laying hens is believed to have additional benefit because the eggs contain higher omega-3 fatty acids and lower omega-6.

Barnyard millet is also an important source of fodder in the Himalayan region. Barnyard millet leaves are broad, and the plant picks up good growth in short time and thus produces voluminous fodder. Barnyard fodder is highly palatable and can be used for making hay or silage.

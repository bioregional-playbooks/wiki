Millets possess unique nutritional characteristics specifically have complex carbohydrates, rich in dietary fibre as well as unique in phenolic compounds and phytochemicals having medicinal properties. Millets are natural source of iron, zinc, calcium and other nutrients that are essential for curbing the problem of malnutrition in India. They have higher content of niacin, B6 and folic acid, and calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium and zinc. Finger millet is the richest source of calcium (300- 350 mg/100 g) and other small millets are good source of phosphorous and iron. Millets are easy to digest, contain a high amount of lecithin and are excellent for strengthening the nervous system.

Millets contain slow releasing glucose, i.e., low in glycemic index. This is very much important in fighting the global problem of diabetes. It is well recognized that, the incidence of diabetes mellitus and gastro-intestinal tract related disorders are minimal among the population using these grains as staple food. Its fibre content also helps to prevent constipation and may reduce the risk of developing bowel disorders including bowel, colon.

## Barnyard Millet Nutrition

In the Indian Himalayan region, barnyard millet is traditionally used a substitute for rice. The grains are dehulled, cooked and consumed like rice. Barnyard millet porridge (locally called mad- ira ki kheer) is a popular sweet dish in Uttarakhand. In southern

India, barnyard millet is used in traditional preparations such as idli, dosa and chakli. The millet has also been used to develop products such as biscuits, sweets, noodles, rusk, ready mix, popped products and some other speciality foods (Arora and Sri- vastava 2002, Poongodi et al. 2003, Veena et al. 2004, Ugare 2008), but large-scale production needs industry involvement to commercialize the products globally. Barnyard millet is highly suitable for commercial foods for diabetics, infants and pregnant women because of high iron content.&#x20;

However, the non-availability of ready-to-use pro- cessed products has limited the usage and acceptability of barnyard millet, despite its nutritional superiority. There is a need to develop millet-based food products in the form of ready-to-use products and functional foods to meet the demands of the present-day consumers. Value addition to minor millets not only offers variety, convenience and quality food to consumers, but is important for revival of barnyard millet cultivation as well.&#x20;

## Barnyard Millet Nutrition

In the Indian Himalayan region, barnyard millet is traditionally used a substitute for rice. The grains are dehulled, cooked and consumed like rice. Barnyard millet porridge (locally called mad- ira ki kheer) is a popular sweet dish in Uttarakhand. In southern

India, barnyard millet is used in traditional preparations such as idli, dosa and chakli. The millet has also been used to develop products such as biscuits, sweets, noodles, rusk, ready mix, popped products and some other speciality foods (Arora and Sri- vastava 2002, Poongodi et al. 2003, Veena et al. 2004, Ugare 2008), but large-scale production needs industry involvement to commercialize the products globally. Barnyard millet is highly suitable for commercial foods for diabetics, infants and pregnant women because of high iron content.&#x20;

However, the non-availability of ready-to-use pro- cessed products has limited the usage and acceptability of barnyard millet, despite its nutritional superiority. There is a need to develop millet-based food products in the form of ready-to-use products and functional foods to meet the demands of the present-day consumers. Value addition to minor millets not only offers variety, convenience and quality food to consumers, but is important for revival of barnyard millet cultivation as well.&#x20;

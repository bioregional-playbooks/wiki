# Primary Processing

### Setting the context&#x20;

There is a lack of affordable and efficient technologies for community level primary processing of the millets. Existing facilities utilise Paddy processing machines with minimal modifications to process millets leading to poor performance

Millets are different from Paddy and Wheat and so should be the machines for their primary processing. Realising the potential for millets, big players in the grain milling industry have entered the market, without much R\&D inputs.

[Earth 360 Pvt Ventures](https://www.earth360.in/earth360.html) develops Scalable, Efficient and Affordable Primary Processing Technologies to Enable Community Level Millet Processing.&#x20;

[Grading](https://themillet.org/2019/03/07/importance-of-grading-in-community-scale-small-millet-processing/) allows us to remove the smaller, not full formed, and immature grains. It also allows us to separate out seed quality grains from within the lot providing a selection and thereby improving the seed quality.

There are two grain characteristics that are used to grade grains – size and density. We use an eccentric or vibrating grader to achieve size grading and a destoner to achieve density grading. As one would expect, grading and cleaning go hand in hand – as we remove the extremes of the size and density distribution, we remove material other than grains (also referred to sometimes as MOTG).

## Resources from Experts&#x20;

1. Here's a [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m26oWVck-YY) on opportunities in millet processing under the ODOP by PMFME uploaded by NIFTEM Thanjavur
2. Short video series on millet processing [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4jroI0AKyC9avNj1fLKQc78UWAr8sVj) (by Dwiji Guru)\

3. [Farm Easy (a collective of Engineers and entrepreneurs)](https://gofarmeasy.in/), was initiated by The Watershed Support Services and Activities Network (WASSAN). Farm Easy has succeeded in developing a [millet mixie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09O3U0BebQI\&t=194s) that can be used for processing minor millets at the household level or as a nano enterprise. \
   \
   As a test run a few such millet mixies were supplied to villages in the APCNF cluster like Bodlanka in East Godavari for processing Little millet and Foxtail Millet in January 2020. The rate of millet rice consumption among the above habitats increased significantly due to reduced drudgery in millet processing. The increase in household consumption has resulted in increased millet acreage in the area. It has also turned women operating these mixies into micro-entrepreneurs who provide services for a fee. (Watch a video showcasing this work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09O3U0BebQI\&t=194s))\
   \
   Farm easy supplies **modified mixies along with 3 sieves for INRs.3200/unit.** RythuSadikara Samstha is planning to upscale the millet microentrepreneur model in all the APCNF resource villages to enhance millet consumption at the household level.  \
   FarmEasy also sells weeders, sprayers, sieves in addition to the mixie [here](https://gofarmeasy.in/shop/).\

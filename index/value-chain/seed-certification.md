# Seed Certification

### For CSOs:

Here is a [training manual](https://millets.res.in/pub/2019/GAP\_manual.pdf) for para-seed workers or 'seed certifiers' that can support FPOs & Farmers to produce high quality milled seeds (By WASSAN).

[Indian Minimum Seed Certification Standards](https://odishaseedsportal.nic.in/SeedPortalData/Resource%20Material/INDIAN\_MINIMUM\_SEED\_CERTIFICATION\_STANDARDS.pdf) was published in 2013 by the Central Seed Certification Board Department of Agriculture & Co-operation, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India.

[Here](https://seednet.gov.in/QualityControl/SeedStandard13.htm) is a table on Seed Standards uploaded by Seednet India Portal for different crops which includes millets like sorghum (jowar), finger millet (ragi), and pearl millet (bajra).
